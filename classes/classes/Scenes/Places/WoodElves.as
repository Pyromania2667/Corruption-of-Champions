You examine the tree and fail to properly remember which variety it belongs to, not to mention the small green lights that dance around it, a bit like the faerie fires in a bog. As you are examining the tree you hear a crystal clear, beautiful laugh to your left, followed by the sounds of shuffling leaves. You ready yourself for combat and turn around just in time to see a blonde woman with pointed ears and green eyes staring at you from the middle of the clearing. She wears an outfit of white silk that covers her but does little to hide her feminine curves, which stand out on her delicate and ethereal frame in a way no human could match. You imagine even most succubi would be jealous of the natural way she wears her beauty, as if some goddess had sculpted her form from marble stone, clear water and living wood, then animated it with the lithe spirit of a fairy. You are still gazing, spellbound by her appearance, when she calls out to you in a clear, musical voice." +

Your combined juices froth and drip down from your pussies where they rub together, already soaking the bed below." +
